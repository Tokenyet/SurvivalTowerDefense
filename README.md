## About this project
This project is the combination of [Bloc](https://github.com/felangel/bloc/tree/master/packages/bloc), [Flame](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame), [Entitas_ff](https://github.com/mzaks/entitas_ff), the minimal working game that mix of all flutter and game concept to work. Feel free to fork It to make any game, and don't remember to open an issue to tell me how's going with your game :P Here is the [demo](https://youtu.be/1duYtd_sKMQ).

1. [flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) - Best cross-platform framework
2. [go-flutter](https://github.com/go-flutter-desktop/go-flutter) embeddeder for desktop powered by golang 

All prepared, you could use `hover run` to run the project.
